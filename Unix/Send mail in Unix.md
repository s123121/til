You can easily send mail in Unix by using `sendmail` command
```
sendmail [option] [recipient]
```
For example:
```
sendmail test@example.com <  /tmp/email.txt
```
Or you can just type directly into the terminal without piping the email template.
One interesting thing is that you can end the message with `.` in the new line and press `Enter`
